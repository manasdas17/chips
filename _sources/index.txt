Chips v0.1
==========

Chips is a Python library for designing hardware devices. Some of its key features include:


- High level device modeling language makes device design simpler and more
  powerful.

- Provides fast native simulations that integrate with Python.

- Python extension modules such as Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib and PIL provide a
  rich verification environment.

- Automatic generation of synthesizable VHDL.

- Plugin mechanism also allows C++ and graphviz outputs to be generated.

- Existing VHDL IP can be imported.

- Seamless co-simulation of C++ and VHDL outputs.
